# Welcome to the Oxford IT Services Python Kick-off course!

## What is Python and why should i use it?
Python is an easy-to-use and robust *Object-Oriented* programming language. A lot of new software application are built with Python for this reason. It is used in other areas of computer science such and software engineering, cybersecurity, data science, bioinformatics and health sciences, geography and many many other fields.
Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy (similar to using R).

This is a workshop that will introduce you to the basics of python, demonstrate its usability for data exploration, manipulation and visualisation.
Due to the breadth of the language there are still many topics left for you to explore! Here we teach you the necessary skills.

We encourage users to begin work in order of the Notebooks:

**1-data-exploration.ipynb**

**2-data-manipulation.ipynb**

**3-data-visualisation.ipynb**

## How do i get started?
For this tutorial we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, that allows us to write comments and code together 
in a visually appealing way. The code works directly in the notebooks by using `SHIFT+ENTER` within the code window.
It works on both Python 2.x and Python 3.x but 
for this tutorial we shall work with Python 3.x. 
For those working with the IT services desktops, Jupyter Notebooks is already pre-installed in the computer. 
For thsoe working on your own laptop please follow the instructions [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQe615jrQxMzak3I_Hd8K6GRraP2nZHn/view?fbclid=IwAR1LosetUEIgg8G-3lDWx1Gpn-v6_7ehjZU0ngy75vrAN34LP1VIqv-uEDY) for set up
